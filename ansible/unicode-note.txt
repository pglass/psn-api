We run into unicode errors only when running python with systemd. In that
context, python attempts to encode all unicode strings as ascii, which fails
whenever we have non-ascii unicode characters (in game titles or whatever).

Why does Python want to encode unicde as utf-8 in my local shell, but as ascii
when started from a systemd script?

Maybe it was a locale config issue. It looked like maybe systemd ran my python
script with the C/POSIX locale (which only supports the "portable character
set" aka ascii[1][2]). And I could reproduce the error in my local shell by
setting LANG=C or LC_ALL=C. The "working" locale in my local shell seemed to be
en_US.UTF-8 (which was the system default).

Okay, sure. But setting these locale env variables to UTF-8 in the systemd
script didn't fix anything. Changing locales didn't seem like the right fix
anyway. My script should work (or at least, not hard error) regardless of the
environment's locale settings.

The basic issue was that we had non-ascii characters in unicode strings, so
obviously we can't use ascii to decode them. Encoding as utf-8 is the obvious
solution here, since it is ascii-compatible. But how do we do this:

- Add ''.encode('utf-8') calls everywhere? No. Not happening.
- Call sys.setdefaultencoding()? No. This affects too many things besides just
printing[3].
- Wrap sys.stdout with an automatic unicode encoder. This is not terrible... If
we have an intelligent encoder allows byte strings to pass through and encodes
unicode strings, that would work.
- Use PYTHONIOENCODING. This "overrides the encoding used for
stdin/stdout/stderr"[4]. It lets us select the encoding (utf-8) and the error
handling strategy.

--- SOLUTION ---
PYTHONIOENCODING seems to be the best option. It does what we want (the print
statement will encode unicode strings as utf-8) and also lets us specify
the error handler to avoid hard-failures as needed.
